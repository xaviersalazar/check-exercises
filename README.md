# check-exercises

A small program that checks for your missing assignments

**Currently shows all missing exercises from the entire curriculum* 

## Requires
Before you run the script, you need to install:
+ Python 3

    [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
+ GitPython

    Use the command below from the terminal

    `$ pip3 install gitpython`
    
     If that doesn't work, you don't have pip3 installed so you have to use
     
     `$ pip install gitpython`
     
## Usage
1. Clone this repo by downloading it or using

    `$ git clone git@github.com:xaviersalazar/check-exercises.git`

2. Within the folder __check-exercises__, run the command

    `$ python3 check-exercises.py`

You'll need the link to your repo, both the ssh or https version will work.
