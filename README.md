# check-exercises

A small program that checks for your missing assignments

## Requires
Before you run the script, you need to install:
+ Python 3

    Use the link below, scroll down to the bottom of the page and you'll find the downloads.

    [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
+ GitPython

    Use the command below from the terminal

    `pip3 install gitpython`
    
     If that doesn't work, you don't have pip3 installed so you have to use
     
     `pip install gitpython`
     
## Usage
1. Clone this repo by downloading it, or in the terminal use

    `git clone git@github.com:xaviersalazar/check-exercises.git`

2. From your terminal navigate to the folder __check-exercises__. This will be the folder you cloned in the previous step, or if you downloaded it, it will be a .zip file. Within the __check-exercises__ folder run the command

    `python3 check-exercises.py`

You'll need the link to your repo, both the ssh or https version will work.
